Title: Understanding Negative Response Codes (NRCs) in Unified Diagnostic Services

Introduction:
This tutorial aims to provide an in-depth explanation of negative response codes (NRCs) in the Unified Diagnostic Services. NRCs are essential for understanding and troubleshooting diagnostic communication between an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and a diagnostic tool or software. The tutorial covers two ranges of NRCs: 0x01 to 0x7F and 0x80 to 0xF0.

Part 1: NRC Range 0x01 to 0x7F

1. Service Not Supported (0x11)

   - This NRC occurs when the requested service ID is not supported by the ECU software.
   - For example, if the software only supports services 0x10, 0x27, and 0x31, but you request service 0x22 or 0x2E, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x11 (Service Not Supported).
2. Sub-Function Not Supported (0x12)

   - This NRC is returned when the requested sub-function is not supported by the ECU software for the specific service.
   - For instance, if a service only supports sub-functions 0x01, 0x02, and 0x03, but you request sub-function 0x07, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x12 (Sub-Function Not Supported).
3. Incorrect Message Length (0x13)

   - This NRC occurs when the data length specified in the request message does not match the actual data bytes provided.
   - For example, if you specify a data length of 4 bytes but provide more or fewer data bytes, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x13 (Incorrect Message Length).
4. Response Too Long (0x14)

   - This NRC is returned when the ECU's response data exceeds the maximum allowed frame size, and the diagnostic tool or software does not support flow control.
   - In such cases, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x14 (Response Too Long) to indicate that the response cannot be sent due to its excessive length.
5. Busy Repeat Request (0x21)

   - This NRC is sent when the ECU is currently processing a previous request and cannot handle a new request immediately.
   - The diagnostic tool or software should wait for a few seconds (typically 4-5 seconds) and then repeat the request.
6. Condition Not Correct (0x22)

   - This NRC indicates that the conditions for executing the requested service or sub-function are not met.
   - The specific conditions and scenarios that trigger this NRC will be covered in the next part of the tutorial.
7. Request Sequence Error (0x24)

   - This NRC occurs when the diagnostic tool or software does not follow the correct sequence of requests for a specific service or operation.
   - For example, if a security access service requires first requesting a seed and then providing a key, but the key is sent without requesting the seed, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x24 (Request Sequence Error).
8. Security Access Denied (0x33)

   - This NRC is returned when the diagnostic tool or software attempts to access a secured or critical service without proper authentication or security access.
   - For example, trying to access a routine control service without unlocking security access will result in NRC 0x33 (Security Access Denied).
9. Invalid Key (0x35)

   - This NRC indicates that the key provided for security access is invalid or incorrect.
   - The diagnostic tool or software should request a new seed and provide the correct key.
10. Exceeded Number of Attempts (0x36)

    - This NRC is sent when the diagnostic tool or software exceeds the maximum allowed number of attempts to provide a valid key for security access.
    - The ECU will block further attempts for a certain period to prevent brute-force attacks.
11. Required Time Delay Not Expired (0x37)

    - This NRC occurs when the diagnostic tool or software attempts to perform an operation or service before the required time delay has elapsed.
    - For example, if a service requires a 5-second delay after a previous request, but the next request is sent before the delay expires, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x37 (Required Time Delay Not Expired).
12. Upload/Download Not Accepted (0x70)

    - This NRC is typically associated with bootloader flashing or programming operations.
    - It indicates that the ECU cannot accept the data upload or download due to issues such as invalid memory addresses or data corruption.
13. Transfer Data Suspended (0x71)

    - This NRC is also related to bootloader flashing or programming operations.
    - It signifies that the data transfer has been suspended or interrupted, potentially due to data corruption, memory address issues, or other problems.
14. General Programming Failure (0x72)

    - This NRC is a general indication of a programming failure during bootloader flashing or programming operations.
    - It is returned when the specific root cause of the failure cannot be identified or is unknown.
15. Wrong Block Sequence Counter (0x73)

    - This NRC is associated with block transfer operations, where blocks of data are transferred in a specific sequence.
    - If the diagnostic tool or software sends a block with an incorrect sequence counter, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x73 (Wrong Block Sequence Counter).
16. Request Correctly Received, Response Pending (0x78)

    - This NRC indicates that the ECU has received the request correctly, but the response is pending due to various reasons, such as processing delays or state transitions.
    - The diagnostic tool or software should wait for the ECU to provide the actual response.
17. Sub-Function Not Supported in Active Session (0x7E)

    - This NRC occurs when the requested sub-function is not supported in the current active diagnostic session.
    - For example, attempting to perform a routine control operation in the default diagnostic session when it is only supported in the extended diagnostic session will result in NRC 0x7E (Sub-Function Not Supported in Active Session).
18. Service Not Supported in Active Session (0x7F)

    - Similar to the previous NRC, this NRC is returned when the requested service is not supported in the current active diagnostic session.
    - The diagnostic tool or software should transition to the appropriate diagnostic session to access the desired service.

Part 2: NRC Range 0x80 to 0xF0
The tutorial promises to cover the NRC range of 0x80 to 0xF0 in the next part, providing detailed explanations and scenarios for each NRC in this range.

Conclusion:
By understanding the various negative response codes (NRCs) and their meanings, diagnostic technicians and software developers can effectively troubleshoot and resolve communication issues between ECUs and diagnostic tools or software. This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive guide to interpreting and addressing NRCs, enabling more efficient and accurate diagnostic processes.

Title: Understanding Negative Response Codes (NRCs) in Unified Diagnostic Services - Part 2

Introduction:
In the previous tutorial, we covered the negative response codes (NRCs) in the range of 0x01 to 0x7F. This tutorial will focus on the NRC range of 0x80 to 0xF0, providing explanations and examples for each NRC in this range.

Part 2: NRC Range 0x80 to 0xF0

1. RPM Too High (0x81)

   - This NRC indicates that the requested action will not be performed because the server's prerequisite condition for RPM (revolutions per minute) is not met.
   - For example, if the requirement specifies that the ECU should not enter the extended diagnostic session when the engine RPM exceeds 3000, but the tester attempts to enter the extended session with an RPM of 3600-3700, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x81 (RPM Too High).
2. RPM Too Low (0x82)

   - This NRC is the opposite of the previous one, indicating that the requested action will not be performed because the server's prerequisite condition for RPM is not met due to the RPM being too low.
   - For instance, if the requirement states that the ECU should not enter sport mode when the engine RPM is below 3000, but the tester requests the sport mode routine with an RPM below the threshold, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x82 (RPM Too Low).
3. Engine is Running (0x83)

   - This NRC signifies that the requested action cannot be performed because the engine is currently running.
   - For example, if the requirement specifies that software flashing should not occur in the programming session when the engine is running, but the tester attempts to enter the programming session with the engine running, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x83 (Engine is Running).
4. Engine is Not Running (0x84)

   - This NRC is the opposite of the previous one, indicating that the requested action cannot be performed because the engine is not running.
   - For instance, if the requirement states that the ECU cannot actuate primary valves when the engine is off, but the tester tries to actuate the valves with the engine off, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x84 (Engine is Not Running).
5. Engine Runtime Too Low (0x85)

   - This NRC indicates that the requested action will not be performed because the server's prerequisite condition for engine runtime is too low, which is not met to read emission parameters.
   - For example, if the requirement specifies that the engine runtime should be above a certain threshold to read emission-related information, but the tester attempts to read this information when the engine runtime is too short, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x85 (Engine Runtime Too Low).
6. Temperature Too High (0x86)

   - This NRC signifies that the requested action will not be performed because the server's prerequisite condition for temperature is too high, which is not met.
   - For instance, if the requirement states that the coolant system should be switched off only when the temperature goes below a specific threshold, but the tester tries to switch off the coolant system when the temperature is too high, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x86 (Temperature Too High).
7. Temperature Too Low (0x87)

   - This NRC is the opposite of the previous one, indicating that the requested action will not be performed because the server's prerequisite condition for temperature is too low, which is not met.
   - For example, if the requirement specifies that the coolant system should be switched on only when the temperature goes above a critical value, but the tester tries to start the coolant routine when the temperature is too low, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x87 (Temperature Too Low).
8. Vehicle Speed Too High (0x88)

   - This NRC indicates that the requested action will not be performed because the server's prerequisite condition for vehicle speed is not met due to the vehicle speed being too high.
   - For instance, if the requirement states that the ECU should not enter the extended diagnostic session when the vehicle speed exceeds 25 km/h, but the tester attempts to enter the extended session with a vehicle speed of 80 km/h, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x88 (Vehicle Speed Too High).
9. Vehicle Speed Too Low (0x89)

   - This NRC is the opposite of the previous one, indicating that the requested action will not be performed because the server's prerequisite condition for vehicle speed is not met due to the vehicle speed being too low.
   - For example, if the requirement specifies that the ECU should enter sport mode only when the vehicle speed is above 180 km/h, but the tester requests the sport mode routine with a vehicle speed of 100 km/h, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x89 (Vehicle Speed Too Low).

The tutorial promises to cover the remaining NRCs in the range of 0x88 to 0x93 in the next part.

Conclusion:
By understanding the NRCs in the range of 0x80 to 0xF0, diagnostic technicians and software developers can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues related to various server prerequisite conditions, such as RPM, engine state, temperature, and vehicle speed. This tutorial aims to provide practical examples and requirements to aid in comprehending and addressing these NRCs in diagnostic communication scenarios.

Title: Understanding Negative Response Codes (NRCs) in Unified Diagnostic Services - Part 3

Introduction:
In the previous tutorials, we covered the NRC ranges of 0x01 to 0x7F and 0x80 to 0x93. This tutorial will focus on the remaining NRCs in the range of 0x94 to 0xF0, providing explanations and examples for each NRC.

Part 3: NRC Range 0x94 to 0xF0

1. Throttle Position Too High (0x8A)

   - This NRC indicates that the requested action will not be performed because the server's prerequisite condition for the throttle position being too high is not met.
   - For example, if the requirement states that the ECU cannot decrease the throttle position when the target torque speed is higher than the current speed, but the tester tries to decrease the throttle position using the routine control service (0x31), the ECU will respond with NRC 0x8A (Throttle Position Too High).
2. Throttle Position Too Low (0x8B)

   - This NRC is the opposite of the previous one, indicating that the requested action will not be performed because the server's prerequisite condition for the throttle position being too low is not met.
   - For instance, if the requirement specifies that the ECU cannot increase the throttle position when the target torque speed is lower than the current speed, but the tester attempts to increase the throttle position using the routine control service (0x31), the ECU will respond with NRC 0x8B (Throttle Position Too Low).
3. Transmission Range Not in Neutral (0xAC)

   - This NRC signifies that the requested action will not be performed because the server's prerequisite condition for the transmission range being in neutral is not met.
   - For example, if the requirement states that the ECU cannot read emission-related information when the gear is in neutral, but the tester tries to read emission-related information using the service 0x19 (sub-function 0x11) with the gear in neutral, the ECU will respond with NRC 0xAC (Transmission Range Not in Neutral).
4. Transmission Range Not in Gear (0x8D)

   - This NRC indicates that the requested action will not be performed because the server's prerequisite condition for the transmission range not being in a specific gear is not met.
   - For instance, if the requirement specifies that the ECU cannot activate brake valves when the vehicle is not in gear, but the tester tries to activate brake valves using the routine control service (0x31, sub-function 0x01) with the transmission not in gear, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x8D (Transmission Range Not in Gear).
5. Brake Switch Not Closed (0x8F)

   - This NRC signifies that the requested action will not be performed because the server's prerequisite condition for the brake switch being closed is not met.
   - For example, if the requirement states that the ECU cannot illuminate the rear light when the brake is not applied, but the tester tries to run a routine (0x31, 0x01, routine identifier 0x85, 0x6E) to illuminate the rear light with the brake switch open (brake not applied), the ECU will respond with NRC 0x8F (Brake Switch Not Closed).
6. Voltage Too High (0x92)

   - This NRC indicates that the requested action will not be performed because the server's prerequisite condition for the voltage being too high is not met.
   - For instance, if the requirement specifies that the ECU cannot work at a voltage higher than the calibrated level (e.g., 12.5V), but the tester tries to read the diagnostic session with a voltage of 12.78V, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x92 (Voltage Too High).
7. Voltage Too Low (0x93)

   - This NRC is the opposite of the previous one, indicating that the requested action will not be performed because the server's prerequisite condition for the voltage being too low is not met.
   - For example, if the requirement states that the ECU cannot work at a voltage lower than the calibrated level, but the tester tries to read the diagnostic session with a voltage of 0.59V, the ECU will respond with NRC 0x93 (Voltage Too Low).

Conclusion:
By understanding the NRCs in the range of 0x94 to 0xF0, diagnostic technicians and software developers can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues related to various server prerequisite conditions, such as throttle position, transmission range, brake switch status, and voltage levels. This tutorial aims to provide practical examples and requirements to aid in comprehending and addressing these NRCs in diagnostic communication scenarios.
