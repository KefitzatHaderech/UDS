### UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) Tutorial: Input Output Control by Data Identifier (Service 0x2F)

#### Introduction

Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) is a protocol used in the automotive industry for diagnostics and communication between a vehicle's electronic control unit (ECU) and a diagnostic tool. This tutorial focuses on the Input Output Control by Data Identifier (DID), specifically the service 0x2F. This service is essential for controlling I/O (sensors/actuators) to achieve desired outcomes through feedback systems.

#### Purpose of I/O Control by Data Identifier (0x2F)

The primary purpose of controlling the system/IO is to achieve the desired results with the help of a feedback system. This involves manipulating the inputs and outputs of various sensors and actuators within the vehicle to ensure optimal performance and response.

#### Request and Response Formats

**Positive Response Frame Format:**

- **Service ID:** 0x2F
- **Example:** Reading current throttle position data.

    **Request:**
    ```
    0x2F 0x05 0x0C
    ```
    Where:
    - `0x05` represents a short-term adjustment.
    - `0x0C` represents the control state with 12% throttle position.

    **Response:**
    ```
    0x62 0x05 0x0C 0x06
    ```
    Where:
    - `0x62` is the positive response.
    - `0x05 0x0C` is echoed back.
    - `0x06` represents the data (throttle position at 6%).

**Negative Response Frame Format:**

- **Service ID:** 0x7F followed by 0x2F.
- **Example of Negative Responses and their NRCs:**

    - `0x13`: Incorrect Message Length Or Invalid Format in PCI length declaration.
    - `0x22`: Conditions Not Correct (e.g., criteria for security access not met).
    - `0x31`: Request out of range (invalid DID).
    - `0x33`: Security Access Denied (request made without unlocking the ECU).
    - `0x35`: Invalid Key (key value does not match stored value).
    - `0x36`: Exceed number of attempts (maximum invalid attempts exceeded).
    - `0x37`: Required Time Delay not expired (delay timer active and request sent prematurely).

[*] --> Incorrect_Length : 0x13
Incorrect_Length --> Request_Out_of_Range : 0x31
Request_Out_of_Range --> Security_Access_Denied : 0x33
Security_Access_Denied --> Conditions_Not_Correct : 0x22
Conditions_Not_Correct --> [*] : 0xFF

### Practical Example: Reading Throttle Position

**Reading Current Throttle Position Data:**

1. **Initial Request:**
    ```
    0x2F 0x22 0x1B 0x1C
    ```
    - This request asks for the current throttle position.

2. **Immediate Response:**
    ```
    0x62 0x22 0x1B 0x1C 0x06
    ```
    - Positive response indicating the throttle position is at 6%.

3. **Delayed Response (after 5 seconds):**
    ```
    0x2F 0x22 0x1B 0x1C
    ```
    - Request sent again after a delay to ensure consistent data retrieval.

### Supported Negative Response Codes (NRCs) for Service 0x2F

1. **Incorrect Message Length or Invalid Format (0x13):**
    - Triggered when the request message has an incorrect length or invalid format.

2. **Conditions Not Correct (0x22):**
    - Occurs if the request does not meet certain criteria, such as unmet security access conditions.

3. **Request Out of Range (0x31):**
    - When the DID requested is not supported or is invalid.

4. **Security Access Denied (0x33):**
    - When a request is made without proper security access.

5. **Invalid Key (0x35):**
    - When the key value in the request does not match the stored value in the server.

6. **Exceed Number of Attempts (0x36):**
    - Triggered when the number of invalid attempts exceeds the allowed maximum.

7. **Required Time Delay Not Expired (0x37):**
    - When a request is made before the required time delay has expired.
