# Diagnostic Session Control (0x10)

**Understanding Diagnostic Session Control:**

- Diagnostic Session Control is primarily used to switch from one session to another within the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS).
- It encompasses several sub-functions, though in this tutorial, we'll focus on four main ones:
  - Default Session
  - Programming Session
  - Extended Diagnostic Session
  - Safety System Diagnostics.

**Message Transmission and Response Handling:**

- When transmitting messages related to Diagnostic Session Control, it's crucial to understand the structure of the request and response.
- For instance, when sending a request with Service ID 0x10 and sub-function 0x01 (Default Session), you'll receive a positive response with a positive response code (0x50) and a corresponding Positive Response Code (PRC).
- The length of the response is determined by the PCI (Protocol Control Information), which typically follows the Service ID.

**Implementation Overview:**

- Before diving into the implementation details, let's recap some essential aspects.
- The Service ID and PCI length are constants and must be accounted for in your implementation.
- For example, Service ID 0x10 signifies Diagnostic Session Control, and the PCI length determines the length of the subsequent data.

**Available Sub-Functions:**

While we've discussed four main sub-functions, it's essential to be aware of others for comprehensive understanding. These include:

- Sub-function 0x00: Reset
- Sub-functions 0x02, 0x03, and 0x04: Default, Programming, and Extended Diagnostic Sessions
- Sub-functions 0x05 to 0x07: Reserved
- Sub-functions 0x42 to 0x5F: Vehicle Manufacturer Specific
- Sub-functions 0x60 to 0x70: System Supplier Specific
- Sub-function 0x7F: Reserved for Negative Response

## Diagnostic Sessions

1. **Default Diagnostic Session**:

- This session is typically used for standard diagnostic tasks like reading sensor data or retrieving fault codes.

Hex Example:

```sh
Request: 0x10 0x01
```

Response:

```sh
Response: 0x50 0x01
```

In this exchange, the diagnostic tool requests to enter the default diagnostic session (0x01), and the ECU responds positively, indicating successful entry into the default session.

2. **Programming Diagnostic Session**:

- This session is used for ECU programming or flashing. It often requires higher privileges and security.

Hex Example:

```sh
Request: 0x10 0x02
```

Response:

```sh
Response: 0x50 0x02
```

Here, the diagnostic tool requests entry into the programming session (0x02), and the ECU responds positively, granting access to the programming session.

3. **Extended Diagnostic Session**:

- This session might offer extended capabilities beyond what's available in the default session. It could include special functions or advanced diagnostics.

Hex Example:

```sh
Request: 0x10 0x03
```

Response:

```sh
Response: 0x50 0x03
```

Similar to the previous examples, the tool requests entry into the extended diagnostic session (0x03), and the ECU confirms the entry.

4. **End of Line Session**:

- Regardless of the session type, sessions should be properly terminated when diagnostic tasks are complete.

Hex Example:

```sh
Request: 0x10 0x04
```

Response:

```sh
Response: 0x50 0x04
```

## Coding Example

- This code defines a class DiagnosticSessionControl with methods send_request to create a request message and handle_response to interpret a response message.
- The example usage demonstrates sending a request to enter the Default Session and handling a positive response. You can extend this class to handle other sub-functions and responses as needed.

```py
class DiagnosticSessionControl:
    # Constants for Service ID and PCI Length
    SERVICE_ID = 0x10
    PCI_LENGTH = 0x01
  
    # Sub-function Codes
    SUBFUNCTION_DEFAULT = 0x01
    SUBFUNCTION_PROGRAMMING = 0x02
    SUBFUNCTION_EXTENDED = 0x03
    SUBFUNCTION_EOL = 0x04
  
    # Positive Response Code
    POSITIVE_RESPONSE = 0x50
  
    def send_request(self, subfunction):
        """
        Sends a Diagnostic Session Control request.

        Args:
            subfunction (int): The sub-function code.

        Returns:
            bytes: The request message.
        """
        return bytes([self.SERVICE_ID, subfunction])

    def handle_response(self, response):
        """
        Handles a Diagnostic Session Control response.

        Args:
            response (bytes): The response message.

        Returns:
            bool: True if the response is positive, False otherwise.
        """
        if response[0] == self.POSITIVE_RESPONSE and response[1] == self.SUBFUNCTION_DEFAULT:
            return True
        else:
            return False

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    dsc = DiagnosticSessionControl()

    # Send a request to enter Default Session
    request_default_session = dsc.send_request(DiagnosticSessionControl.SUBFUNCTION_DEFAULT)
    print("Request Default Session:", request_default_session.hex())

    # Simulate receiving a response
    response_default_session = bytes([0x50, 0x01])  # Example positive response
    print("Response Default Session:", response_default_session.hex())
    print("Response Positive?", dsc.handle_response(response_default_session))
```
