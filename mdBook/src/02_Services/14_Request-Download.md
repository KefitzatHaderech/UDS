# Request Download (Service ID 0x34)

## Introduction

In this guide, we will explore the "Request Download" service, designated by Service ID 0x34, which falls under the Upload and Download Functional Data group. This functional group consists of five services, and Request Download is the first one. Understanding this service is crucial as it lays the foundation for comprehending the subsequent services in this group.

## Objective of Request Download

The primary objective of the Request Download service is to initiate a data transfer from the client (tester) to the ECU. Contrary to the typical understanding of "download," where data is retrieved from a source, in this context, downloading refers to transferring data to the ECU. The service is used to request permission for this data transfer.

### Concept Clarification

To clarify, in the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) context, "downloading" data means transferring data from the client to the ECU. For example, when you are flashing an ECU, you are downloading (transferring) new firmware from your diagnostic tool to the ECU.

## Process Overview

### Steps Involved

1. **Client Requests Download**: The client (tester) sends a request to the ECU indicating the intention to transfer data.
2. **ECU Validates Request**: The ECU checks the request conditions and if valid, sends a positive response.
3. **Data Transfer Initiation**: Upon receiving a positive response, the client begins the data transfer process.

### Example Scenario

Consider the scenario where you need to flash new firmware to an ECU. The request download service initiates this process by requesting permission from the ECU to start the data transfer.

## Key Terminologies

Before diving into the request and response frames, it is essential to understand some key terminologies used in the Request Download service.

### Data Format Identifier

The Data Format Identifier is a one-byte parameter where each nibble represents different encoding methods:

- **High Nibble**: Compression method
- **Low Nibble**: Encryption method

For example:

- `0x00`: No compression or encryption.
- `0x11`: Compressed and encrypted data.

### Address and Length Format Identifier

This parameter specifies the format for the memory address and memory size:

- **High Nibble**: Number of bytes for memory address
- **Low Nibble**: Number of bytes for memory size

For instance:

- `0x21`: Indicates that the memory address is 2 bytes and the memory size is 1 byte.

### Maximum Number of Block Length

This parameter, included in the positive response from the ECU, informs the client about the maximum number of bytes that can be included in each data transfer block.

### Block Sequence Counter

The Block Sequence Counter starts from `0x01` and increments by one for each subsequent data block. This counter ensures the correct sequencing of data blocks during transfer.

## Request and Response Frames

### Request Frame

The request frame structure for the Request Download service includes:

1. **Service ID (0x34)**: Identifies the Request Download service.
2. **Data Format Identifier**: Specifies compression and encryption methods.
3. **Address and Length Format Identifier**: Indicates the number of bytes used for memory address and size.
4. **Memory Address**: The starting address for data transfer.
5. **Memory Size**: The size of the data to be transferred.

### Example Request Frame

For a request where data is neither compressed nor encrypted, with a 2-byte memory address and 1-byte memory size:

```
34 00 21 00 10 00 04
```

Here:

- `34`: Service ID
- `00`: Data Format Identifier (no compression, no encryption)
- `21`: Address and Length Format Identifier
- `00 10`: Memory Address
- `00 04`: Memory Size

### Positive Response Frame

The positive response frame from the ECU includes:

1. **Positive Response ID (0x74)**: Indicates a positive response to the Request Download service.
2. **Length Format Identifier**: Specifies the format for the maximum block length.
3. **Maximum Block Length**: Indicates the maximum number of bytes per data transfer block.

### Example Positive Response Frame

For a response where the maximum block length is 1024 bytes:

```
74 30 04 00
```

Here:

- `74`: Positive Response ID
- `30`: Length Format Identifier
- `04 00`: Maximum Block Length (1024 bytes)

## Practical Implementation

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Request Download Initiation**

   - **Request Frame**:
     ```
     34 00 21 00 10 00 04
     ```
   - **Explanation**: Request to download 4 bytes of data to memory address `0x0010`.
2. **ECU Response**

   - **Positive Response Frame**:
     ```
     74 30 04 00
     ```
   - **Explanation**: ECU allows the data transfer with a maximum block length of 1024 bytes.

## Negative Response Codes

Negative responses indicate errors or unsupported actions. Common error codes include:

- **0x13**: Incorrect message length or invalid format.
- **0x22**: Conditions not correct.
- **0x31**: Request out of range.
- **0x70**: Upload/Download not accepted.

## Log Analysis

Logs are crucial for debugging and validating the functionality of the Request Download service. Logs typically capture request and response frames, allowing analysis of whether the requested action was successfully applied.

### Example Log Entry

**Request**:

```
34 00 21 00 10 00 04
```

**Response**:

```
74 30 04 00
```

Logs can be examined using text editors or specialized log analysis tools to verify the correctness of the communication control actions.

## Conclusion

The Request Download service (Service ID 0x34) is essential for initiating data transfers from a client to an ECU. By understanding and utilizing its components and sub-functions, engineers can effectively manage and troubleshoot data download processes within vehicle networks. This guide has provided a detailed overview of the service's purpose, terminologies, frame structures, and practical implementation steps, offering a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage this service in automotive applications.
